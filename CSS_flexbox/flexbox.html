          <h2>What are code editors?</h2>
          <p>A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.</p>

          <h3>IDE</h3>
          <p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">IDE</a> (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a “whole project.”
             As the name suggests, it’s not just an editor, but a full-scale “development environment.”</p>
          <p>An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files,
             provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like git), a testing environment, and other “project-level” stuff.</p>
          <p>If you haven’t selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> (cross-platform, free).</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank">WebStorm</a> (cross-platform, paid).</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>For Windows, there’s also “Visual Studio”, not to be confused with “Visual Studio Code”. “Visual Studio” is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. 
            It’s also good at JavaScript. There’s also a free version <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Community</a> .</p>
          <p>Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer’s salary, so just choose the best one for you.</p>
          <h3>Lightweight editors</h3>
          <p>“Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple.</p>
          <p>They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.</p>
          <p>The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.</p>
          <p>In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there’s no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.</p>
          <p>The following options deserve your attention:
            <ul id="links">
              <li><a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom </a> (cross-platform, free).</li>
              <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code </a> (cross-platform, free).</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> (cross-platform, shareware).</li>
              <li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> (Windows, free).</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim </a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> are also cool if you know how to use them.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
           <h3>Let’s not argue</h3> 
           <p>The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.</p>
           <p>There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.</p>
           <p>The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.</p>
